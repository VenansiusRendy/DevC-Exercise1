                I am enrolled into Coursera full stack course using via the means of MEAN stack that stands for MongoDB,
                Express.js, Angular and Node.js. Which all is based on javascript.

                    <h3>HTML</h3>
                    <p>
                        I start with HTML in June 2019 through various online resources. To start of I use Udemy and
                        Codecadamy that teaches me the basics of the codes. The more I learn about html the more I
                        realise that there are many ways available to achieve the same goal.

                    <h3>CSS</h3>
                    <p>
                        After my HTML course I jumped into another CSS course in the same platform. As the styling takes
                        place my webpages becomes more intersting and it looks way better than I first started. From
                        there I learn about bootstrap as a front end framework which helps a lot in desinging a website.

                        After knowing how to build static website, I want to learn more about dynamic website and
                        started my journey learning about JavaScript. It is the hardest language that I am learning but
                        it holds a lot of promises and it excites me.

                        After gaining confidence in myself that I know how to build static website. I offered my friend
                        to build a business website for them for free. It may not be the best looking but it has working
                        contact form and fully responsive website. I am proud and happy to have done that for my friend.

                        is not easy for me to understand due to language barrier. However, the more I learn the more
                        intersting it gets.

                        After graduated in 2016 I went back to my hometown and work as accountant in a company with no
                        accounting software in place. I gain a lot of experience and know how much technology affects
                        the operational part of business and grew more interest. I tried to built an ERP for the company
                        with a free lance programmer but to no success as it is a very big project. In the end the
                        company resulted to work with consultant.
